## Info
Icarus is an unenrollment exploit for Kernver 4 and non-keyrolled devices.

If you have a keyrolled device (unable to boot shims), see [Badapple-Icarus](https://docs.titaniumnetwork.org/kajigs/badapple-Icarus).

## Requirements:
- **Kernver 4**: To check your Kernver, enter Recovery Mode and press the `TAB` key. See this [example](https://cdn.fanqyxl.net/demo.png).
- **Version V125 - V127**: You can upgrade/downgrade using images from [Chrome100](https://chrome100.dev).
- A **NON-Keyrolled Chromebook**.
- A **PERSONAL** laptop (no Crostini, no VMs, etc.).
- A **Brain**.

## Steps:

1. Grab a shim for your board from [fanqyxl's file host](https://dl.fanqyxl.net/ChromeOS/Prebuilts/Icarus/).
2. Flash the shim onto a minimum 8GB USB drive using `dd`, [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), or [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/).
3. Boot into Recovery Mode by holding the `ESC + Refresh + Power` buttons.
4. Enter Developer Mode by pressing `Ctrl + D`.
5. Once on the Developer Mode block screen, press `ESC + Refresh + Power` again.
6. Plug in your USB drive and wait for the shim to run the payload.

### Continuing On:

1. Once the payload is done and you're back at the OOBE (Out-of-Box Experience):
   - Connect your Chromebook to Wi-Fi using the "Quick Settings" menu, but **do not continue** with the OOBE.
2. Start your server and change your connection settings to "Manual":
   - Set the "Secure HTTP" IP address to `152.53.243.119`.
   - Set the "Secure HTTP" port to `8126`.
   - **Note**: Using a public server is a security risk. Host your own server using the instructions in the "Advanced" section.
3. Click **Save**.
4. Continue with the OOBE, and Icarus should unenroll your device!

<summary>Device still enrolling or getting "Can't reach Google"?</summary>

  - Ensure the shim used on the target ChromeOS device was built with the same CA (Certificate Authority) used to generate the SSL certificates.
  - If you're using a prebuilt shim and don't know what CA was used, consider building your own shim and SSL certificates if nothing else works.
  - Note: Being above ChromeOS v130 or below ChromeOS v125 will cause the target ChromeOS device to reject the connection to the MiniServer, resulting in the "Can't reach Google" screen.
  - If nothing works, run your own icarus server.
